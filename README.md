# Passport PKI Demo Suite

This repository contains three comprehensive demos that showcase a two-layer security architecture combining PKI certificates for Service-to-Service Authentication and Service Passports (Service Certificates with embedded User JWTs) for enterprise-grade authentication and authorization.

## Demo Naming Convention

The demos follow a clear naming pattern that reflects their functional purpose:

- **`s2s-authn-demo`**: **Service-to-Service Authentication** - Basic PKI certificate chain validation (S2S Authn)
- **`s2s-authn-user-authz-demo`**: **Service-to-Service Authentication + User Authorization** - PKI + embedded user JWTs (S2S Authn + Authz via Service Passports)
- **`jwt-extractor-demo`**: **JWT Extraction Tool** - Technical inspection of Service Passport JWT mechanisms

## Overview

The demo suite demonstrates a distributed service architecture with:
- **Patient Service** (Prod Region - US/Europe/Asia)
- **Media Service** (Prod Region - US/Europe/Asia) 
- **Storage Service** (Global)

### Two-Layer Security Model:
- **Layer 1**: Service Certificate Chain (S2S Authn)
  - Prod Region services are confined to their respective regions
  - Prod Region services can access global services
  - Certificate chain validation enforces access boundaries
- **Layer 2**: Service Passports with Embedded User JWT (S2S Authn + Authz)
  - Fine-grained resource permissions per user
  - Role-based access control across services
  - User context preserved across service boundaries

This architecture enables scalable, cross-Prod Region service access control with fine-grained user permissions.

## Demo Descriptions

**Purpose**: Technical inspection and analysis of embedded JWT extraction for healthcare services

**What it demonstrates**:
- JWT embedding mechanism in X.509 healthcare service certificate extensions
- JWT extraction and validation process from healthcare service certificates
- Healthcare user JWT content decoding and analysis
- Certificate extension inspection and identification

**Technical Details**:
- **Custom OID**: `1.3.6.1.4.1.999.1.1` for User JWT extension
- **JWT Contents**: Healthcare user ID, email, medical roles, tenant, region, expiration
- **Extension Analysis**: Identifies and explains certificate extensions
- **Validation Workflow**: Step-by-step JWT extraction process for healthcare services

**Key Features**:
- ‚úÖ Healthcare JWT embedding/extraction demonstration
- ‚úÖ Medical service certificate extension analysis
- ‚úÖ Healthcare user JWT content inspection and decoding
- ‚úÖ Healthcare service integration workflow documentation

## Architecture Benefits

The complete demo suite showcases a healthcare-focused Service-as-Passport architecture:

1. **ÔøΩ Scalable Healthcare PKI Infrastructure**: Regional CAs enable distributed healthcare certificate management
2. **üåê Cross-Region Medical Services Authentication**: Regional healthcare services can access global storage services
3. **ÔøΩ‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Fine-Grained Medical Authorization**: User JWTs provide individual-level access control for healthcare roles
4. **üîÑ Separation of Concerns**: PKI handles service identity, JWTs handle user medical permissions
5. **üìã Standards Compliance**: Uses standard X.509 extensions and JWT formats for healthcare interoperability
6. **ÔøΩÔ∏è Healthcare Storage Integration**: Clear workflow for medical services to extract and use user context

## Healthcare Service Architecture Patterns

### Service Authentication (Layer 1 - PKI)
- **Regional Services**: PatientService, MediaService (confined to their regions)
- **Global Services**: StorageService (accessible by all regional services)
- **Certificate Validation**: Regional services must present valid certificates from their regional CA
- **Access Control**: Regional services cannot directly access other regional services

### User Authorization (Layer 2 - Embedded JWT)
- **Medical Roles**: Doctor, Nurse, Patient, Admin
- **Resource Permissions**: patient-read, patient-write, media-read, storage-read, storage-write
- **HIPAA Compliance**: User context preserved across service boundaries
- **Tenant Isolation**: Hospital, Clinic, PatientPortal organizational boundaries

## Use Cases

This healthcare Service-as-Passport architecture is ideal for:

- **Healthcare environments** requiring both service and user-level security
- **Multi-region medical deployments** with centralized authentication
- **Medical storage services** needing fine-grained access control
- **Healthcare microservices architectures** requiring embedded user context
- **HIPAA compliance scenarios** demanding certificate-based authentication
- **Telemedicine platforms** with cross-region patient data access
- **Medical imaging services** requiring role-based authorization
- **Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems** with multi-tenant support

## Security Features
